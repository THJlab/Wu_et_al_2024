Scripts used in the publication Wu et al., 2024 to generate tails counts from bam files and subsequent analysis.

All required packages are listed within individual scripts and should be installed indvidually following Python and R classical proccedures. No specific additional instalation is required for running the associated piece of code.

Scripts were ran on a MacBook pro with Apple M1 Pro ChIP and 16GB of memory. Individual script are expected to run in a matter of few minutes.

Each script can be run individually in Python or RStudio. Applied to a bam file the scripts will generate counts of tails according to their nature. These counts can further be used for downstream analyses.

An example bam file can be found at http://genome-ftp.mbg.au.dk/public/THJ/Wu_et_al_2024_example_bam_file/
